   Processing recipe (with wrapper):
-----------===============--------------

01 - Follow steps 01 to 03 of the full verions.

02 - Run the following script, specifying the arguments:
     ./diffusion_processing_wrapper.sh <experiment>
     				       number_of_b_values
				       number_of_directions(including trace, if any) 
			      	       number_of_slices 
			      	       pixel_size(in bytes) 
			      	       number_of_b0_components 
			      	       size_x_dimension(in pixels) 
			      	       size_y_dimension(in pixels) 
				       number_of_traces

03 - Follow the full recipe from step 09 (inclusive) onwards.


   Processing recipe (full version):
-----------===============--------------

From the .REC, .PAR and DICOM files:

01 - From the DICOM, get the "gradient orientation direction" (RL = 2005,10b0, AP = 2005,10b1, FH = 2005,10b2). Verify that the extract_gradient_directions_from_PAR.sh script extracts the components in the right order.

02 - Save the .REC file as "<experiment>/<experiment>_acquisition.rec".

03 - Save the .PAR file as "<experiment>/<experiment>_acquisition.par".

04 - Extract the gradient directions from the .par file using this command:
     ./extract_gradient_directions_from_PAR.sh	 <experiment>/<experiment>_acquisition.par 
						 <experiment>/<experiment>_gradient_directions.dat

05 - Split the .rec file in a b0 file and a remainder:
     ./split_b0_remainder.exe <experiment>/<experiment>_acquisition.rec 
     			      number_of_b_values 
			      number_of_directions(including trace, if any) 
			      number_of_slices 
			      pixel_size(in bytes) 
			      number_of_b0_components 
			      size_x_dimension(in pixels) 
			      size_y_dimension(in pixels) 
			      <experiment>/<experiment>_b0.raw
			      <experiment>/<experiment>_b0_remainder.raw

06 - Remove the trace (if any) from the remainder:
     ./remove_trace.exe <experiment>/<experiment>_b0_remainder.raw 
     			number_of_b_values 
			number_of_directions(including trace) 
			number_of_traces 
			number_of_slices 
			pixel_size(in bytes) 
			size_x_dimension(in pixels) 
			size_y_dimension(in pixels) 
			<experiment>/<experiment>_traces.raw
			<experiment>/<experiment>_traces_remainder.raw

07 - Split the remainder in the b-value series:
     ./split_raw_by_b-value.exe <experiment>/<experiment>_traces_remainder.raw 
     				number_of_b_values 
				number_of_directions 
				number_of_slices 
				pixel_size(in bytes) 
				size_x_dimension(in pixels) 
				size_y_dimension(in pixels) 
				<experiment>/<experiment>_b_value_series-

08 - For each series, append the b0 file as a prefix:
     ./append_b0_in_front.exe <experiment>/<experiment>_b0.raw
     			      <experiment>/<experiment>_b_value_series-000.raw 
			      <experiment>/<experiment>_b_value-bbbb.raw

09 - Using MedSquare, open the <experiment>/<experiment>_b_value-bbbb.raw file and save it as an Analyze file.

10 - Using Bioimage, open the Analyze file under the tensor utility, set the b-value field, load the <experiment>/<experiment>_gradient_directions.dat file as the directions, set the mask threshold as 0 and compute the tensor, then save the tensor file.

11 - Using bioimage, open the tensor file under the tensor analysis tool, compute and then it is done.
